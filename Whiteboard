1.Implement the core BlackJack rules (details in the next section)
2. Write unit tests that prove that your game implements those rules
3. Pick two or more of the following ways to make your game better
  a. Make the user experience better (e.g. make things look nicer, introduce a delay when dealing/revealing cards)
  b. Give the user casino chips and allow them to bet and win (or lose!)
  c. Implement the full rules (allow the user to split or double, you can look those rules up online)
  d. Use the same shuffled stack of one or more decks across rounds, giving people that can count cards an advantage.
